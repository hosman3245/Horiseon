# Description

this  project was designed to motivate and test the knowlwdge of the students regarding the engagement of their class activity and their overall input during the class sessions so therfore i have implemented the necessary considertaion by making the website accessible with a codebase that follows accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines.

# Installation

my installation process started with creating a repositry on my github account and shortly afterthat i have decided to clone the repositry to my local computer then i begin to deploy my project by using the git add, git commit and git push commands to save and push the code into my github repositry.  

# Usage

To improve the user's accessbility to the webpage i have added the html semantic elements to define different parts of the webpage so the semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the user and developer. i have also removed the repeptive codes both in the index,html and style.css to give the user more freedom in order to navigate through the webpage.

# Behind The Scenes

I have logged comments into the index.html and style.css so you can see why the changes were necessary for the webpage to meet the accessbility standards.these comments are logged if you also want to see the debugging messages and i have removed the repetitive codes to give the codebase more simplicity.
